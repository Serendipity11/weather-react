# Getting Started with Create React App

# My Awesome Project
The React JS weather app is a sleek and user-friendly application that provides up-to-date weather information including wind and precipitation data, as well as a forecast for the next 5 days.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, API

I was focused on making a minimalistic and monochromatic UX for this application. I implemented open-Weather API's to display up-to-date weather conditions.

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I would update my media queries and would focus on a mobile-first approach. I would then work on adding a timing feature and leaderboard

## Lessons Learned:
Don't forget to update the media queries to make sure everyone can see your content, rather than just the people that have a screen size like yours.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
